<h1>Warning About Colors
</h1>

<p>
Battle.net has a restriction on color-making characters, and upon leaving the game (and going back to the regular chat), battle.net will check the name in memory, and if it finds a color, it will drop your battle.net connection and add you to their ban list. This is stored on their servers, not yours, so you can not override it. Thus, you will have to reconnect to your ISP in order to reconnect to battle.net, and if you have a static IP, you won't be able to connect until the admins clean their banned IPs, or you find another extremely lagged Battle.Net server (shouldn't be hard to do nowadays). So, before leaving a pre-game chat where colors were used, you must change your name to something that doesn't use colors, or simply uncheck the <i><a href="advanced.htm#allowbanned">Allow Banned Characters</a></i> option and apply. You can use colors in-game, but Battle.net will ban your IP regardless of what's in your temporary memory. Thus, I only recommend using colors to go in random games and leave before the game starts.
