<h1>What's New in Nick Spoofer 1.06</h1>
<hr width="25%" align="left">
WHAT'S NEW IN 1.06
<hr width="25%" align="left">
<ul>
<li>Now supports Brood War 1.08 final.</li>
<li>Choose Version dialog removed.</li>
<li>Colors box now includes the colors that it will be in both the pre-game and in-game sessions.</li>
<li>Now minimizes to the system tray for memory conservation.</li>
<li>Supports Windows NT/2000/XP. Previous versions of the Nick Spoofer would not work on the NT architecture due to process permissions (you would get an Error 02). This has been fixed in 1.06.</li>
<li>Tooltip help is now included. Hold your mouse over any feature of the Nick Spoofer to get a description of its uses.</li>
<li>Bug fix: No more "Overflow" errors on program launch. This was due to screen coordinates beyond the integer maximum.</li>
<li>Bug fix: Nick Spoofer no longer launches off-screen, rendering it invisible.</li>
<li>Bug fix: Nick Spoofer no longer changes your name to "Error 01" when launching the Nick Spoofer before you launch Brood War.</li></ul>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left">
WHAT'S NEW IN 1.05a
<hr width="25%" align="left">
<ul>
<li>Complete rewrite since I lost the original source. Notify me of any regressions.</li>
<li>Redesigned the interface and merged configuration into the Advanced tab rather than a separate application.</li>
<li>Nick Spoofer now saves your last settings as to whether or not advanced mode is expanded and the position on the screen.</li>
<li>Now compatible on 1.07 and 1.08 Revision O! Full support for 1.08 final will be available in Nick Spoofer version 1.05b.</li>
<li>Removed "Switch to Brood War After Change" since it never really worked anyway.</li>
<li>Compiled HTML Help file now included.</li></ul>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left">
WHAT'S NEW IN 1.04
<hr width="25%" align="left">
<ul>
<li>Two new options added to configuration:</li>
<ul><li>"Retain Nickname Throughout Session" - Normally, Starcraft resets your spoofed nickname after you leave a game. This keeps your current name until you change it.</li>
<li>"Disable Nickname Checking Interval" - Recommended only if you have problems with the Nick Spoofer checking your nickname every 2 seconds. Click the Retreive box to manually check your nickname with this option enabled.</li></ul>
<li>Fixed "Switch To Brood War After Change" option - it now completely restores Brood War, however, it does so by hiding the window and restoring it (due to issues otherwise). You may not wish for this to happen, so disable this option if it causes problems.</li>
<li>Found that spaces may trigger Battle.net bans. Spaces may not be inserted into a name without the "Use Colors" box being checked.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left">
WHAT'S NEW IN 1.03
<hr width="25%" align="left">
<ul><li>Added a Configuration tool with the following options:</li>
<ul><li>"Clear Nick Box On Change" - clears the textbox containing the new name after submission.</li>
<li>"Switch To Brood War After Change" - Switches to the Brood War window after submission, however, it currently doesn't restore the window.</li>
<li>"Always Show Color Warning" - To always remind you to read the readme.txt file, for those who may have others accessing the file.</li>
<li>Enable "Safe Mode" - Disable colors, previously activated by downloading a .reg file.</li></ul>
<li>Fixed color insertion bug to insert color after the caret instead at the end of the box.</li></ul>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left">
WHAT'S NEW IN 1.02
<hr width="25%" align="left">
<ul><li>Required text in the Modify box to prevent problems from within Starcraft.</li>
<li>Added a "safe" mode. Download the .reg file from www.scbackstab.com to activate the no-color mode (useful if you're on a static IP and don't want to be banned).</li>
<li>Increased maximum length to 21 characters, from 20.</li>
<li>Removed the manual updating of your battle.net name in favor of the name automatically updating every 2 seconds.</li>
<li>Use of registry to display the color warning box, will only show once (not once per session).</li>
<li>Changed frame labels to be more descriptive ("Retreive" and "Modify").</li>
<li>Changed program icon.</li>
<li>Changed name to Nick Spoofer to match the more commonly-used name.</li></ul>
<br>
<hr width="25%" align="left">
WHAT'S NEW IN 1.01
<hr width="25%" align="left">
<ul><li>Fixed space bug in earlier versions where your name would have a space before the ":" colon.</li>
<li>Fixed earlier bug which the current Battle.net name would only display the first 15 characters.</li></ul>
