<h1>Select Brood War Version
</h1>

<p>
The first time you launch the application, it will ask you what version of the StarCraft Brood War patch to use. This is either version 1.07 or 1.08 alpha revision O, and can be found by launching StarCraft to the main menu at the bottom right corner of the screen. You can change your patch version at a later time by holding shift and right-clicking the "Advanced >>" button.
