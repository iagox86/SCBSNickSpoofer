This is the legendary SCBSNickSpoofer, created by Yoshi at
SCBackstab.com a million years ago (actually, in 2001), and posted in
2016 with permission from the original author!

The original version was held tightly to the chest, and even
watermarked. Yoshi shared the source with me, and since I never delete
anything, I've always had it. He got in touch with me recently, and gave
me permission to post this!

This is super meaningful to me (iago-x86), because it started my
original foray into game hacking, which eventually led to UNickSpoofer
(which I wrote and will post eventually), reverse engineering, JBBot,
JavaOp, and, eventually, a career in information security!

Would I be in infosec without SCBSNickSpoofer? Dunno, but I ran into
this at the perfect time in my life to start doing game hacking. :)
